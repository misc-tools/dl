- Start the project. 
- Some libraries that I think should be used in this project: 
  + `tagsoup`: to parse HTML page to find link 
  + `optparse-applicative`: to parse command line argument 
  + `async`: for concurrent downloads.

- To implement: Given a URL, count how many resources of each type. 
- Syntax should be: 
```sh
$ dl --explore --url www.google.com
```

- `optparse-applicative` supports 4 kinds of options: regular options,
  flags, arguments and commands.
